### The 1.0 Vision

Emulator frontend for any emulator that lets us Intent-invoke them, that gives you a browsable, metadata-enhanced list of games from a cloud storage service, which syncs savegames back. We have sections for recently played games, recently added games, and favorites.

### Iterations

1. Get a list of games from a Drive folder, you pick a ROM, we sync it down, invoke the game, then we sync the savegame back ASAP.
1. Split games by console type, add support for every console that we know how to support (i.e. ones that Robert Broglia emulators support).
1. Add metadata support and image fetching, make it :sparkle:
1. Add recents, recently added, favorites
1. Add Dropbox support
1. Ouya / Android TV / Fire TV support?
